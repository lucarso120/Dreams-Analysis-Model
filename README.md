# Dreams-Analysis-Model

In this ongoing project, I am creating a model to classify if a dream report is wheter positive or negative.
For this, i used a database provided by other contributors to the research. 
In the files, it can be seen the process for cleaning and preprocessing the data. Afterwards, the model works using a Bag of Words and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
